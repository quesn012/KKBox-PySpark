NOTE:

This is my portion of a project I worked on with a group, but I wanted to post it on my github to come back to in the future and try more with. The goal of the project was to just evaluate different big data platforms for prediction on the KKBox churn data set. I specialized in the PySpark and Hive aspects of the project, using Hive to mung the 30+ gigs of data into a format ready for prediction, then PySpark to try to predict churn with a few different models. Note the hive data is just directly files while the PySpark is in a notebook.
